# Automate the Boring Stuff Solutions

These are my solutions for [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://www.automatetheboringstuff.com) by [Al Sweigart](http://www.alsweigart.com/). 

All the practice projects are in the `projects` folder of each chapter. (i.e., `./chapter-3/projects/`). I just wanted to add that I followed the flow of the book and did not use concepts that were not included in that specific chapter of the book.

Automate the boring stuff is the first programming book I ever read and it is definitely one of my favorite books. Recently, I picked up the book again, to try and finish it.

This repository is basically just a way for me to share my solutions with some of my friends. Though I made the repo public because there are simply no solutions for the practice projects in the book. Maybe this could help out somebody. Or someone could review my code instead.
